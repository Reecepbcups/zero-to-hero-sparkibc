lib.rs - defines files in the project & exports them for use
contract.rs - where actual contract logic happens (uses messages)
error.rs - contract errors for when logic does not line up with what you want

helpers.rs - we deleted this as it is not needed, also removed from lib.rs

msg.rs - holds messages which we use in the project & has more info in there.
